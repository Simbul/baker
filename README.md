Project Baker
=============

**The HTML5 ebook framework to publish interactive books & magazines on iPad & iPhone using simply open web standards**  
<http://bakerframework.com>  



WHAT IS BAKER
-------------

To this day, ebooks have been limited by an old standard created in the pre-Kindle and pre-iPad era.
Baker is the first stepping stone to show that we could already be using the powerful HTML5 language
to create books with real typography, real layouts and high-quality design.



HOW TO USE BAKER
----------------

Creating an ebook in HTML5 to be used with Baker is a three-steps operation. 
It's easier done than said! ;)

1. DESIGN
   * Create you publication as one or more **HTML5 files** like a standalone website
   * Design your publication to fit multiple screen (using CSS media-queries)
   * You can use **any** feature in WebKit: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (video, audio, fonts, jQuery, Google Maps, etc)
   * On iPad/iPhone you can constrain the height to match the page size or make it scrollable if you need longer pages
   * For best results, consider having 1 HTML for each chapter/section/article and use the native vertical scrolling.
   * ...remember: it's a publication. If you want to build an app, check [PhoneGap](http://www.phonegap.com/). ;)

2. PACKAGE
   * The publication must be contained in a single Hpub file
   * Each chapter/section/article (horizontally swiped on the iPad) should be a single HTML file inside the Hpub
   * Create a Hpub book.json file: title, author, pages, etc. (see below)
   * All the assets must be contained within the publication folder or its subfolders
   * Check the example book from the website for an hands-on example
   * See either [Standalone tutorial](https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/4.0-tutorial-for-Standalone) or [Newsstand tutorial](https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/4.0-tutorial-for-Newsstand) for more info

3. PUBLISH
   * Download the Baker Framework Xcode project from http://bakerframework.com (or GitHub).
   * Download Xcode from the Mac App Store or from the Apple Developer website.
   * Decide if you want to release using the [Standalone tutorial](https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/4.0-tutorial-for-Standalone) or [Newsstand tutorial](https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/4.0-tutorial-for-Newsstand) mode and follow the tutorial accordingly.
   * Select the Baker Scheme (Simulator or Device) from the toolbar dropdown.
   * Run and check that everything works correctly _both_ on simulator and device.
   * Check [this page](https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/Problems-and-Debugging) if you encounter any problem.
   * Create an Apple iPhone Developer account to publish on the App Store.
   * If you are using Newsstand, follow the instruction on the Apple iPhone Developer website to create a new free subscription.
   * Follow the instructions on the Apple iPhone Developer website to submit your book to the app store.


BOOK.JSON
---------

This is an example of a minimal book.json file:

```json
{
  "title": "The Study in Scarlet",
  "author": "Arthur Conan Doyle",
  "url": "book://bakerframework.com/books/arthurconandoyle-thestudyinscarlet",

  "contents": [
    "Article-Lorem.html",
    "Article-Ipsum.html",
    "Article-Gaium.html",
    "Article-Sit.html",
    "Article-Amet.html"
  ]
}
```

For all the details and the advanced options, check the [Hpub specification on the wiki](https://github.com/Simbul/baker/wiki/hpub-specification).


SHELF.JSON
----------

This is an example of the shelf.json file that is downloaded by Baker in Newsstand mode to check the available publications:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "a-study-in-scarlet",
    "title": "A Study in Scarlet",
    "info": "The original masterpiece by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle",
    "date": "1887-10-10 10:10:10",
    "cover": "http://bakerframework.com/newsstand-books/a-study-in-scarlet.png",
    "url": "http://bakerframework.com/newsstand-books/a-study-in-scarlet.hpub",
    "product_id": "com.bakerframework.Baker.issues.a_study_in_scarlet"
  }
]
```
